                      <h3>Hello, My name is Joseph Rudd</h3>
                      <p> I am a Software Engineer, living and working in Scio, Oregon.</p>
                      <p>"   To Me   "</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Reading lines of code is like reading a river while fishing.</li>
                        <li>Finding and fixing bugs resembles Rockhounding, when you find a beautiful crystal hidden in the ground.</li>
                        <li>Compiling code, then watching it run, is similar to building a car and driving it away.</li>

                  <h2>A Peek Into Joe</h2>
                  <div class='person'>
                    <p>Ever since I was young I've been intrigued by video games. I've always wanted to create them. I have been in manual labor most of my life, from custom home construction to working with a large crew building and repairing roads, And yet my passion for learning to program always leads my thoughts. <br><br>I started my journey in 2016. After watching a news report about lighting drone shows at night. That's when I decided, it was time to learn how to program. So I'm indulging in my curiosity. As a post Pyrotechnic, I needed to understand how this type of programming was accomplished. I began at <i>Skillcrush</i> where I completed a boot camp in Front-end web development. To my surprise learning HTML and CSS was not enough. That's when realization set in, it takes a team of programmers and multiple software languages, to produce this level of programming. That's when I knew, I wanted to become part of a team of high-level programmers. Now, as a student in the Software Engineering program at <span><i>Thinkful</i></span>, I am currently pursuing my dream along with continuing my ongoing learning process. <br><br>
                    Despite my overwhelming drive to write code, I do enjoy other leisure activities. I am an avid fisherman both fly fishing and conventional. I also enjoy Rockhounding as well as mushroom hunting. It is always good to enjoy the outdoors, just as much as sitting down and writing code for hours.
